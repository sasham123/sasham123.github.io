            <p>Ever since I was little, cooking has always been one of my favorite activities. I used to love helping my parents cook dinner every night, and now love making my favorite foods for my friends and family.</p>

            <p>Finding the time to cook proper meals in college can be a little tough, but over the years I have come up with various recipes that are easy to make, affordable, and delicious.</p>

            <p>Making a tasty, nutritious breakfast is an important way for me to start the day off right. Some of my favorite dishes to make include omelettes, avocado toast, and breakfast burritos.</p>

            <p>I always find myself getting hungry in between my classes, so I love to make a quick bite to eat when I have a break. Some of my favorite lunch meals include salads, sandwiches, and quesadillas.</p>

            <p>Dinner is probably my favorite meal of the day. When I'm at school, I love cooking for my roommates and friends that come over. My favorite dishes to make include spicy vodka pasta, at-home burrito bowls, and pizzas.</p>
